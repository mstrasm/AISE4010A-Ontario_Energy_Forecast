# AISE4010A-Ontario_Energy_Forecast
The code provided trials multiple models on the Ontario Energy Demand dataset provided by Kaggle

The work involved was completed by: 
Luke Mayer - Developed the CNN-LSTM: model and HyperTuned using RandomSearch.
Mitchell Strasman - Developed the Pre-Processing for the CNN-LSTM model and LSTM model. Developed the LSTM model.
Aaron Sohrabian - Developed the Pre-Processing for the GRU model. Developed the GRU model.
Alex Cavaco-Donia - Advised on model creation and developement.
